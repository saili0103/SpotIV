# Nonlinear outcome models with possibly invalid IVs

## SpotIV
Semiparametric outcome model with invalid IVs for causal inference (Li and Guo, 2020)

Main R functions for SpotIV method are in "SpotIV-main.R". Majority rule is applied to deal with invalid IVs.

Multiple examples are provided in "SpotIV-example.R"

## Control function methods in semiparametric outcome models

The conventional control function methods are provided in "Valid-control.R" with some examples. It assumes all the IVs are valid.

## Control function methods in probit outcome models

A control variable method for causal inference in probit outcome models with possibly invalid IVs. Examples and main functions are in "Probit-control.R". Majority rule is applied to deal with invalid IVs.
